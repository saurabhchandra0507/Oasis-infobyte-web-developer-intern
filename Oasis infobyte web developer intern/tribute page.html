        <h1>Tribute to Alan Turing</h1>
        <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Alan_Turing_Aged_16.jpg" alt="Alan Turing">
        <p>Alan Mathison Turing was an English mathematician, computer scientist, logician, cryptanalyst, philosopher, and theoretical biologist. Turing was highly influential in the development of theoretical computer science, providing a formalisation of the concepts of algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, which can be considered a model of a general-purpose computer.</p>
        <p>Turing is widely considered to be the father of theoretical computer science and artificial intelligence. During World War II, he worked for the Government Code and Cypher School (GC&CS) at Bletchley Park, Britain's codebreaking centre that produced Ultra intelligence.</p>
        <p>After the war, Turing worked at the University of Manchester on the Manchester Mark I, one of the earliest stored-program computers. He continued his work in computing, producing influential work in artificial intelligence and computational biology.</p>
        <p>Turing died in 1954 from cyanide poisoning, a suspected suicide. In 2009, following an Internet campaign, British Prime Minister Gordon Brown made an official public apology on behalf of the British government for "the appalling way he was treated." Queen Elizabeth II granted Turing a posthumous pardon in 2013.</p>
